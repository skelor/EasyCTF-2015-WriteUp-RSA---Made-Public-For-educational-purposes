All Zob's Fault (crypto 350)
Description:

Apparently our crypto program didn't store the correct phi-value or something for this message; it spits out gibberish when we try to decrypt it. Either the memory had a rare fault or Zob's being an idiot again. Please help.

Hint: Zob works at the Russian Space Agency
The description gave us a url(message), leads to a base64 encoded file.

The hint provded the Zob worked at Russian Space Agency which in short form meant (RSA) meaning that this is RSA crypto problem. 

Based on RSA encipher steps we already know that m is the product of p and q multiplication so the reverse process will be to factor it.
I use msieve to factor the m (modulus)

$ msieve -q 614010459838253953596498114943057697842675637887066261109163514805589167

prp36: 783756020423148789078921701951691559


And we got our p and qs now, so let's calculate d. D according to RSA process is equivalent to A/(E-1)

E was given so we needed to perform a reverse check. 

 p = 783420406144696097385833069281677113

q = 783756020423148789078921701951691559

e = 340035333160956238336074318075946961695270890880263371398510321485728225



import gmpy


 gmpy.invert(e, (p-1)*(q-1))

mpz(65537)


So it's the famous public exponent (e) 65537, and again we know that the problem is tricking us on variable names. Meaning the give E is not actually e but instead it is D

Anyway, so now we can solve the plaintext by t = c^d mod m


>>> d = 340035333160956238336074318075946961695270890880263371398510321485728225


>>> binascii.unhexlify(format(pow(c, d, m), 'x'))


b'flag{l0l_l3l_k1k_k3k_;p;}'


Flag: easyctf{l0l_l3l_k1k_k3k_;p;}
